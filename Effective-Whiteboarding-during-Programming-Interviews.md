# Summary

## Notes and figures on the side
* Use one corner of the whiteboard to note down the requirements you have heard or an example figure that your interviewer has drawn.

## Write Clearly
* Try to write as clearly as possible while not slowing down a lot. Yes they are not interested in seeing your calligraphy skills BUT you are still writing this for someone else to read. It has to be legible. The cleaner you write the easier it is for your interviewer to understand.

##  Use the Space Efficiently
* Several times, candidates start writing XL size code and then have to inevitably write in super small font cramming in many lines in a small area. Then they turn to use arrows to point to other parts of the board where they will write the remaining code. Avoid that. It’s hard to follow code written on different parts of the board.
* Adapt to the size of whiteboard on which you are going to solve the problem. 
* Always leave some room for potential edits e.g. extra parameters, null checks, trivial if conditions etc.

## Edits are part of the game
* Don’t be afraid to change code. Several times, interviewers would modify requirements to see how you handle a slightly different or challenging variation of the same problem.
* You will also have to edit your code if you find a bug during testing. In such cases, instead of overwriting or crossing out code, it’s better to erase and re-write that part of the code.

## Practice!
* Make sure you have a whiteboard at your home. It helps a lot. You should practice solving problems on a whiteboard before your interview.
