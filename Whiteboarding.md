# Whiteboarding

## Slow-down, chill-out, and try to write as neatly as possible.

## Ask questions
* Many interview questions are intentionally vague; the interviewer wants to see how you handle uncertainty and what assumptions you make. If you are implementing an algorithm, what are the constraints? Memory, runtime, size of inputs, etc.
* As you are answering the question talk through what you are doing and what your thought process is. The interview is as much about the how you get to the answer as the answer itself.

## Code how you’d normally code
* One of the most common mistakes I saw was candidates getting lost in their answer. Hopefully you wouldn’t write a 50-line function in “real” life, so don’t do it in an interview. In many ways it is even more important to break up your code when working on the whiteboard; you don’t get to cut-and-paste, and in the heat of an interview it is easy to lose track of state.

## Check your work
* Most errors will happen at the termination cases. The best way to do this is to take a minute to run through the code with some sample input. It’s not unlikely you’ll have missed a case or introduced an off-by-one error, your interviewer won’t mind you taking time to do this, in fact, they’ll probably be impressed.
* Also, check how your code handles unusual inputs and edge cases? Think about how you would unit test the code and write them up on the board.

## Practice
* Think about how you’d implement a JQuery helper or a method from your favorite language’s standard library. Search the web for sample questions—ignoring any site that talks about manhole covers.

## Research
* You’ll undoubtedly get asked about the company’s products and “why you want to work here”. It can be hard to come up with good answers on the spot, so research the company and figure out what you’d say ahead of time.

## Have fun
* More than anything, try to have fun. Be curious and enjoy the challenge. You’ll get more out of process and probably come across better all the more because of it. As well as seeing whether you are capable, the interviewer is also looking to see if they would want to work with you.
